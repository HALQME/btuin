# Roadmap

- [x] Input
  - [x] Make input parser stateful (resistant to chunk splitting): `src/terminal/parser/ansi.ts`
  - [x] Resolve ambiguity between standalone `ESC` vs `Alt+Key`
  - [x] Normalize bracketed paste into a single event: `src/terminal/parser/ansi.ts`
  - [x] Integrate bracketed paste on/off into the runtime
- [ ] Mouse
  - [ ] Integrate mouse input (e.g., SGR) into the runtime (enable/disable, finalize event format)
  - [ ] Hit testing (matching coordinates with `ComputedLayout`, determining z-order)
  - [ ] Event bubbling/propagation (child to parent, cancellable event model)
- [ ] Developer Tools
  - [ ] Shell Integration
    - [x] stdout/stderr capture infrastructure (listener/console patch/test mode): `src/terminal/capture.ts`
    - [ ] Create a log UI with `useLog` (capture -> reactive state)
  - [ ] Debug
    - [ ] Inspector mode (visualize borders/coordinates/sizes)
    - [ ] Hot Reload
- [x] Distribution
  - [x] Generate tarball for GitHub Release (including `src/layout-engine/native/`): `.github/workflows/release.yml`
  - [x] Automated check to ensure `npm pack` artifacts work with `src/layout-engine/native/` and `src/layout-engine/index.ts` resolution
- [ ] Inline Mode
- [ ] Components
  - [ ] Bring `TextInput` to a practical level (editing, cursor movement, IME finalization)
  - [ ] `ScrollView` / `ListView` (virtual scrolling as needed, mouse wheel support)
- [x] Safety
  - [x] Add FFI boundary sync tests (Rust constants/structs ↔ JS definitions) to CI
- [ ] Documentation / Starter
  - [ ] Expand `examples/`
